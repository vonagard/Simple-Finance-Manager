A simple Finance Manager app made by me to test my skills. 
What I did in this project:
 - Working with different data types.
 - Experimenting around the date type and it's formatting specifics.
 - Formatting and visualizing data.
 - Created a simple finance.db database, using sqlite3.
 - Created the database tables and columns, amd binded the db structure to functions.
 - Creating a console UI, combining the created structure into a somewhat user-friendly main menu.
 - The program runs from main.py.

This project is still in it's beta phase and could be prone to errors.

 TODO:  Refactor the code.
 TODO:  Improve the logic behind the code.
 TODO:  Create a GUI.
 TODO:  Create an option to choose between console UI and GUI.
 TODO:  Experiment with different databases.
 TODO:  Expand the project and the database (more tables, new columns, etc.).
 TODO:  Gather data for analysis. (I'm not sure how much would be needed for ML and DL models, research that too)
 TODO:  Implement a simple machine learning model to try and give helpful tips about savings. (perhaps regression)
 TODO:  Implement a simple neuron network and test.
