A simple Finance Manager app made by me to test my skills. 
Project run point: main.py.

How this project helped me so far and what i learned:
 - Worked and played around with different data types.
 - Experimented around the 'date' type and it's formatting specifics.
 - Data formatting and visualization.
 - Visualization using print function. Playing around specifics.
 - Plot a diagram.
 - Created a simple finance.db database, using sqlite3.
 - Created the database tables and columns, amd binded the db structure to functions.
 - Creating a console UI, combining the created structure into a somewhat user-friendly main menu.

 TODO:  Experiment with different databases.
 TODO:  Expand the project and the database (more tables, new columns, etc.).
 TODO:  Gather data for analysis. (I'm not sure how much would be needed for ML and DL models, research that too)
 TODO:  Implement a simple machine learning model to try and give helpful tips about savings. (perhaps regression)
